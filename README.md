# Quick Raw OCR
Quick raw OCR is a Windows WPF application to load file and get it's OCR result in a textbox. I have created this application to enhance my skills in .Net, WPF, OOPs and Tesseract.

This application is useful for the developers who want to check the OCR quality of Tesseract while searching for the best OCR engine for their specific requirements. If someone need only raw OCR of the image then this application can be used readily by doing very less modifications in it.
